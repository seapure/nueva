Convolutional Neural Network	
Fully connected Layer : stretch spatial vector into a one dimensional vector
Convolution Layer : preserve sptial information

dot product for the entire depth of layer, so the output; layer * number of filters
zero padding : one of the methods to maintain the size of our layers

the brain/neuron view of CONV Layer : it's just a neuron with local connectivity(Neuron model usually connects to every input)

"filter" == "receptive field"

**Pooling Layer
-makes the representations smaller and more manageable
-operates over each activation map independantly
-do nothing on the depth
ex]max pooling : divide x, y axis with filter size and take the maximum values for each filters
average poling
People have begun to use stride more.(Same feature)
